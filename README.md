- What's up, my username is @orterix
- My goal is to learn coding lingo and understand more about how it works!
- I've spent just under 15 years in the digital marketing space but haven't learned much about coding.
- My current work is centered around bitcoin mining, bitcoin smart contracts, learning more about lightning, nootropic & energy company development, and inventing new products like ModernTie.com
- I'm an entrepreneur through and through with a vision of taking companies from 0 - 10 then gracefully passing the torch to day to day rockstars. If you like new exciting projects and are an expert lets talk!
- Things that excite me are building 3D models that level things up, holding final products that we've designed after months or even years of hard work, and beautiful women.
